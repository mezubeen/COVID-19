        <p class="para">
          The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. <br><br>Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. <strong>Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment</strong>. <br><br>Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. <br><br>People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.
